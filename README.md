Files included here:
 1. An example run on the ACS 2006-2010 dataset (Note that the race variables are included here).
  *  The zip file "Output example run" contains DETAILED output (see Notion under  BayesBinMix/Output). I also saved the R environment from this as acs10_Kmax20.rds. This RDS file contains the output you will see on the function description while the other folder contains more detailed information.

  *  CENSUSBinPrep.R: Script used to convert data to binary variables
  *  censusdata.RData: Original census data 
  *  censusdata_bin.rds: Census data in binary form. This contains a named list for each dataset.
